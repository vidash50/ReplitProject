/*
Create a static method that:
is called removeAll
returns nothing
takes two parameters: an ArrayList of Strings called wordList, and a String called targetWord

This method should go through every element of wordList and remove every instance of targetWord from the ArrayList.

Example:

ArrayList<String> wordList = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("hi","hey","hi","yo"));

removeAll(wordList,"hi");

now wordList is ["hey","yo"]

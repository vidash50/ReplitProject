    /*
    combine two String arrays into one arraylist and return it as a string.

for example:

combineRs(["f","o","o"],[" b","a","r"])
returns "foo bar"


combineRs(["1","2","3"],[" 4"])
returns "1234"

task 2

reverse method reverse a string.
it gets a string and returns it in reverse.

for example:

reverse("foo") ==> "oof"

reverse("student") ==> "tneduts"
